\section{Constructive Solid Geometry}
\subsection{General Concepts}
Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a method for creating more complicated shapes by performing boolean operations on simpler shapes. The available boolean operations include unions, intersections, and differences; the types of shapes vary from one implementation to another, but generally include spheres, rectangular prisms, and cylinders.
\subsubsection{Real-Time Rendering and Image-Based CSG}
One substantial category in CSG is the difference between Real-Time Rendering of CSG objects and Image-Based CSG objects. Real-time rendering poses a number of issues, particularly for shapes that are interactively modified during runtime. While real-time rendering can be accomplished by passing the shape as a mathematically calculated model, this solution is more applicable to static CSG shapes and does not work well for interactive modifications\cite{open_csg}. The alternative solution, image-based rendering algorithms, avoid most of the complex boundary calculations of constructive solid geometry by storing only an image of the shape in the frame buffer\cite{open_csg}.

\subsubsection{CSG Usage}
The shapes are individually created using OpenSCAD, a program for computer assisted design. The shapes are exported as .stl files, which can be read using the reader function located in stlReader.cpp.
